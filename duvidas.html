                    Can Creative Commons give legal advice about its licenses or other tools, or help with CC license enforcement?<BR>

                    <p><b>Can Creative Commons give legal advice about its licenses or other tools, or help with CC license enforcement?</b></p>
                    
                    <p>No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice or legal services. CC is similar to a self-help service that offers free, form-based legal documents for others to use. CC also provides a jurisdiction database where you can compare the international licenses (formerly known at the "unported licenses") and ports (adaptations of the international licenses for particular jurisdictions), and a license versions page where you can compare the differences between license versions.</p>
                
                    <p>The CC wiki has a list of lawyers and organizations who have identified themselves as willing to provide information to others about CC licensing issues. However, please note that CC does not provide referral services, and does not endorse or recommend any person on that list. CC's Affiliate Network may also be a good resource for information about the licenses in a particular jurisdiction, though they should not be contacted for legal advice, at least in their capacity as a member of our CC Affiliate Network.</p>
                
                    <p><b>Who gives permission to use works offered under Creative Commons licenses?</b></p>
                
                    <p>Our licenses and legal tools are intended for use by anyone who holds copyright to the work. This is often, but not always, the creator or author. Creative Commons has no authority to grant permission on behalf of those persons, nor does CC manage those rights on behalf of others. CC offers licenses and tools to the public free of charge and does not require that creators or other rightsholders register with CC in order to apply a CC license to a work. This means that CC does not have special knowledge of who uses the licenses and for what purposes, nor does CC have a way to contact authors beyond means generally available to the public.</p>
                
                    <p><b>If you would like to obtain additional permissions to use the work beyond those granted by the license that has been applied, you should contact the rightsholder. </b></p>
